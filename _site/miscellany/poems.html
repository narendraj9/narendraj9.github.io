<h1 id="from-the-light-of-polaris"><a href="#poem">From the light of Polaris</a></h1>
<p>No new morrow would see me abandon your streets<br />For I have lived there longer than I have lived.<br />There may be no road ahead, only the endless sea<br />With a lonesome traveler laying desirous stares<br />On the setting Sun, as if it would rise in her world<br />To have his message be reached, and felt.<br />It may make no sense to the keepers of wisdom<br />But I’ve never declared my being as wise<br />For it has always been the foolish things<br />That turned passing time to memories<br />And the feet of the wise is shaky and meek<br />When they say it’s faith, and wisdom fleets.</p>
<p>No fears dwell these valleys I walk.<br />Fearful are those with walls raised,<br />Of wanting, or of loss;<br />I have treasures that no one can steal<br />And I hope you still believe in them.</p>
<p>This may never become a poem<br />But then neither those that I have ever written are.<br />Unlike those ramblings from all corners of my heart,<br />Each word here holds a meaning, I assure<br />For it’s hard to say what I mean<br />When it’s not what you want.</p>
<p>I remember more than I thought I would<br />Of the time we lived and the worlds we crafted.<br />The last page of an old notebook still holds a little petal<br />Dearer to me than all roses I have ever seen.<br />I remember your eyes, when we met after days a few<br />And how they were filled with an emotion I don’t have a word for;<br />The corners of my wandering mind still meet the traveler once I was<br />Sometimes the walls bring smiles, sometimes a few regrets you know.</p>
<p>Smile, at least for once for all this world of words<br />Stays in the realm of worthlessness<br />Unless you let your lips curl as your mind reads<br />And your eyes speak as if a young lover kissed them;<br />Shyly blinking with a shimmer of heavens<br />That’s all I am wishing for. That’s all this is for.<br /> –<strong>Genie</strong></p>
<p><a name="poem1"> </a></p>
<h1 id="a-constellation-of-thoughts"><a href="#poem1">A Constellation of Thoughts</a></h1>
<p>Looking at the starry sky tonight, I wonder<br />How many worlds unknown to me, blossom and die.<br />The silence, accompanied by the whisper of drunken winds<br />Engulfs me with the same emotion I had in a crowded place<br />Where my worlds weren’t the twinkling spots on the blue muslin<br />But faces in a hurry, faces painted with worries.<br />Someone was on a run, someone else had the headphones on.<br />One lost in glitter of passing days, the other in music<br />That only lends one the numbness of thoughts.<br />Someone smiled, secretly with a machine he owned,<br />Someone else I saw was too young to understand<br />But it seemed as if he was a lot wiser than me<br />Unknown to things he can’t change, worlds he can’t gauge.</p>
<p>With all this complexity, unfathomable whose depth,<br />Of the lives that live within me, of the ones with me,<br />It’s a strange force that leads us through our days.<br />An eagle’s eye might see the chaos of my world<br />But my world isn’t his. His worlds will never be mine.<br />It’s only in vague terms one can say<br />About things that one finds hard to explain.<br />Maybe it’s the short length of my voyage so far<br />Or maybe it is the bodily boundaries of the cage I wear.<br />Or maybe I am left to adore in awe the creations of the Master<br />Until the call that puts it to an end.</p>
<p><a name="poem2"> </a></p>
<h1 id="an-evening"><a href="#poem2">An Evening</a></h1>
<p>If you let me, I will be the wind to caress your face<br />When the morning light shines with your hair.<br />I will be the loving wetness on your cheeks<br />Subliming and dissolving at the same time.<br />I will be the silence that soothes your forehead<br />With every line struggling to leave a mark;<br />I will be the boredom of your days<br />And the chaos of your celebrations.<br />I will write my heart out on every stone you step upon<br />And still be left with a million words to say.<br />I will be the one you will want on every knock on the door<br />And the smile that adores your face when it’s known.</p>
<p><a name="poem3"> </a></p>
<h1 id="yet-another-rambling-poem"><a href="#poem3">Yet Another Rambling Poem</a></h1>
<p>Another day sinks and disappears,<br />The slate gets a few more strokes.<br />I think and wonder, an unending craving,<br />Looking at the far-away mountains,<br />Draped in snowy mist at a tempting distance–<br /><em>Where would my heart find a better home?</em></p>
<p>Like a childish belief in talks to a God,<br />The presence of a bigger truth turns a myth everyday.<br />Maybe there is no God in the bigger things,<br />No wonders that only an eagle’s eye would see.<br />Maybe life is lived in little pieces only<br />Of bursts of laughter or pangs of pain,<br />Of silence-filled walks or smile-worn days.<br />Maybe that’s all there is to it.<br />And maybe everything else just sets the backdrop<br />Or I would wake up and smile one day<br />Reading this page. Remembering this day.</p>
<p><a name="poem4"> </a></p>
<h1 id="yet-yet-another-little-rambling-poem"><a href="#poem4">Yet Yet Another Little Rambling Poem</a></h1>
<p>Sails of my little boat flapping to the tunes of traveling winds,<br />As I leave the realm of the known to walk with shaky feet again,<br />Play a symphony that only aches my heart even more.<br />I see in the distance, faces new. In the distance, faces old.<br />There is heaviness in my heart for sure.<br />And the chills can still reach my bones, silent and cold.<br />But I walk this wire. I will be someone else again.<br />Like all stories, written on oceanic tides,<br />Mine would become a part of the shore, placid and earthed. [Sedimentary Rock :-D]</p>
<p><a name="poem5"> </a></p>
<h1 id="a-lovely-day"><a href="#poem5">A Lovely Day</a></h1>
<p>A clearer sky emblazoned with such beautifying cloudiness Roofs restlessness and more than a few endless chases. Within life’s confused web, a resting plateau; Only plateaus, no peaks, I have learned. Another day would etch wrinkles on the face of time, Caresses on a wrinkled face, with wrinkled hands, My mind’s box has it’s own definition of beauty, it seems. I wonder and smile, I look look outside, close my eyes. The air is fresher, silence pleasant for a change. Today seems like one of those lovely days.</p>
