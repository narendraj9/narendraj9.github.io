title: About
---

I am a monk living in the mountains. Luckily, I have got Internet over here.
I spend my days learning new things, listening to country music or writing
whatever I feel like writing. I have written a few poems here --
[Words, paper and life](http://blogger.vicarie.in) and
[Poems](/miscellany/poems.html). 


I can happily spend my evenings reading a book on programming, algorithms or
configuring my environment but I won't say I am good at any one of them.
I want to hack XMonad to increase my productivity on the computer as it eats
most of my time.
That _ambition_ keeps me on the road to learning Haskell these days.

And yes, the monk is named Narendra.
