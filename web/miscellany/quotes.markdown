I found this poem from Lord of the Rings really strong. Each line is
written as if it is meant to be very precise and self-contained.

/All that is gold does not glitter,  
Not all those who wander are lost;  
The old that is strong does not wither,  
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.  
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,  
A light from the shadows shall spring;  
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,  
The crownless again shall be king./  


Conal Elliot maintains a huge list of quotes. I wonder if all of them are his
favorites. Here: [Quotes](http://conal.net/quotes.htm)
