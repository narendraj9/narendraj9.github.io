Richard P. Feynman calls it our jewel --
$$ e^{i\theta} = cos(\theta) + i \ sin(\theta) $$

I can easily type mathematical expressions in my blog posts and this post
is dedicated to this revelation! :-D

And a fact just for fun --

The following holds
$$ \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2 \geq \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - z_i)^2 $$
when
$$ x_1 \geq x_2 \geq x_3 ... \geq x_n $$
$$ y_1 \leq y_2 \leq y_3 ... \leq y_n $$
and $z$ is a permutation of $y$.
