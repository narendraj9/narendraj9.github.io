<h1 class="title">Sieve of Eratosthenes</h1>

This post is inspired by the paper&#x2013;
<a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/papers/Sieve-JFP.pdf">The Genuine Sieve
of Eratosthenes</a>.
Since I did the recreational activity of thinking
about the wheels, I intend to talk about their construction and the fact
that they exhibit <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Monoid.html">Monoid</a>
structure.

<div id="outline-container-sieve-of-eratosthenes" class="outline-2">

The problem we are trying to solve here is to find out all primes up to
a given natural number. Eratosthenes came up with an algorithm, famously
known as the <i>Sieve of Eratosthenes</i>. The gist of the algorithm is to
pick up a prime and then cross off all its multiples.
</p>

<p>
We start with writing the numbers from 2 to \(n\). Let's call the first
uncrossed number \(p\). Declare \(p\) as a prime and cross all of its
multiples starting at \(p^2\). Starting at \(p^2\) is a slight optimization
because the smaller numbers must have been crossed by the primes we
discovered earlier. Repeat this procedure until you reach beyond
\(\sqrt{n}\). Declare the numbers that remain uncrossed as primes.
</p>

<p>
The home page of <a href="https://www.haskell.org">haskell.org</a> has the
following definition to illustrate the ease with which Haskell lets us
define infinite structures like the sequence of prime numbers.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell">primes = filterPrime [2..]
  where filterPrime (p:xs) =
          p : filterPrime [x | x &lt;- xs, x `mod` p /= 0]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
But the above algorithm isn't <i>The Sieve of Eratosthenes</i> even though it
is given that name very often. The paper talks about the real <i>sieve</i>
pretty well.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-spinning-wheels-and-the-sieve" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="spinning-wheels-and-the-sieve">Spinning Wheels and the Sieve</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-spinning-wheels-and-the-sieve">
<p>
The above algorithm and its real counterpart can be improved by
providing a better list of numbers to the function \(filterPrime\). For
example, it would be better if we avoid checking even numbers and all
multiples of 3. This can be achieved by generating the list to be passed
using what is known as a <i>wheel</i>.
</p>

<p>
Imagine yourself standing on the number line. You are initially on the
number 1. Now, I am supposed to give you the number of steps you must
take so that you end up on the next number that isn't a multiple of 2 or
3; or in general not a multiple of any of the numbers in a set. What
would be the steps that you would take if that set of numbers happens to
be empty? It's trivially a never-ending sequence of 1's. You just walk
the whole number line stepping upon each number.
</p>

<p>
Now, let's see what the sequence is when we have one element in the set,
say \(p\). Since you are standing on 1, the first multiple is yet to be
encountered and is at \(p\). All numbers between 1 and \(p\) are numbers you
must step upon. So the sequence must contain \((p - 2)\) values equal to 1
followed by a single 2. The 2 in the sequence is for the point in time
when I ask you to jump over \(p\). After this, the same numbers just
repeat themselves indefinitely.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell">genWheel :: Int -&gt; Wheel
genWheel x = let ys = replicate (x - 2) 1 ++ [2] ++ ys in Wheel ys
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Eventually, we would want our wheels to be generated for larger sets of
numbers because we would like to avoid as many multiples of already
known primes as possible. So, we want to combine two wheels, say
<code>genWheel 2</code> and <code>genWheel 3</code>. We definitely expect the <code>combine</code>
operation to be associative and the wheel generated for the empty set to
be its identity element. Yes, it is a Monoid.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell">data Wheel = Wheel { getWheel :: [Int] }
           deriving Show

instance Monoid Wheel where
  mempty = Wheel (repeat 1)
  mappend (Wheel xs) (Wheel ys) = Wheel (go xs ys)
    where go as@(x:xs) bs@(y:ys) | x == y = x : go xs ys
                                 | x &gt; y = go as (y + head ys : tail ys)
                                 | otherwise = go (x + head xs : tail xs) bs
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Our combine operation is defined above as <code>mappend</code>. The idea is to
merge consecutive elements of the wheel when we encounter a mismatch
between the two wheels to be combined. It makes sense because the sum of
consecutive elements on a wheel constitutes a valid step size. So, in
essence we are trying to morph the smaller wheel to look more like the
larger wheel whenever we see a local difference in the two. So, the
identity wheel, i.e. the one generated from the empty set, morphs
trivially into any other wheel by always growing to make its elements
equal to the elements in the other wheel.
</p>

<p>
Now, all we need is a function that would help us generate the sequence
of numbers that we must check for primality given a wheel. So, let's
spin the wheel.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell">spin :: Wheel -&gt; [Int]
spin (Wheel (x:xs)) = spin' xs (x + 1)
  where spin' (y:ys) n = n : spin' ys (n + y)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can either start with 1 or \(x + 1\) where \(x\) is where the wheel
starts. Starting with 1 makes sure that we look at numbers smaller than \(x\).
In the code snippet above, we have generated numbers starting with \(x + 1\) and
hence skipped numbers <code>[2..x]</code>.
</p>

<p>
Here's an example showing it in action.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell">λ&gt; take 10 $ spin (genWheel 2)
[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21]
λ&gt; take 10 $ spin (genWheel 2 `mappend` genWheel 3)
[5,7,11,13,17,19,23,25,29,31]
λ&gt; take 10 $ spin (genWheel 2 `mappend` genWheel 3)
[5,7,11,13,17,19,23,25,29,31]
</pre>
